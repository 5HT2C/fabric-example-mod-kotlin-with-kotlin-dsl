## Setup

0. Create a new mod repository by pressing the "Use this template" button and clone the created repository.

1. Import build.gradle file with IntelliJ IDEA

2. Edit build.gradle and mod.json to suit your needs.
    * Please go to settings.gradle.kts and change value of rootProject.name to your project name. 
    * The "mixins" object can be removed from mod.json if you do not need to use mixins.
    * Please replace all occurences of "modid" with your own mod ID - sometimes, a different string may also suffice.
3. Run!
